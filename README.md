# AirPolutionPrediction
PM 10 distribution prediction with Artificial Neural Network. Our team created the two models for daily and hourly estimation of air pollution in Cracow. We conducted this project as part of the Modelling of Physical Systems course.

## Usage 
Clone the repository and go to specific Jupypter Notebooks.

## Data analysis
Before we jump into the prediction, we analized the dataset, preprocessed it and handled the missing values. The workflow is presented in Jupyter Notebooks:
* [daily prediction](daily_pred/first_touches_to_data.ipynb)
* [hourly prediction](hourly_pred/DataProcessing.ipynb)
